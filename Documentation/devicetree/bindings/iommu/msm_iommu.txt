* Qualcomm MSM IOMMU

Required properties:
- compatible : one of:
	- "qcom,msm-smmu-v2"
- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device. Optional
	offset and length for clock register for additional clock that
	needs to be turned on for access to this IOMMU.
- reg-names: "iommu_base", "clk_base" (optional)
- label: name of this IOMMU instance.

Optional properties:
- qcom,iommu-secure-id : Secure identifier for the IOMMU block
- qcom,secure-context : boolean indicating that a context is secure and
  programmed by the secure environment.
- qcom,alt-vdd-supply : Alternative regulator needed to access IOMMU
  configuration registers.
- interrupts : should contain the performance monitor overflow interrupt number.

- List of sub nodes, one for each of the translation context banks supported.
  Each sub node has the following required properties:

  - reg : offset and length of the register set for the context bank.
  - interrupts : should contain the context bank interrupt.
  - qcom,iommu-ctx-sids : List of stream identifiers associated with this
    translation context.
  - label : Name of the context bank
  - vdd-supply : vdd-supply: phandle to GDSC regulator controlling this IOMMU.

Optional properties:
- qcom,needs-alt-core-clk : boolean to enable the secondary core clock for
  access to the IOMMU configuration registers
- qcom,iommu-bfb-regs : An array of unsigned 32-bit integers corresponding to
  BFB register addresses that need to be configured for performance tuning
  purposes. If this property is present, the qcom,iommu-bfb-data must also be
  present. Register addresses are specified as an offset from the base of the
  IOMMU hardware block. This property may be omitted if no BFB register
  configuration needs to be done for a particular IOMMU hardware instance. The
  registers specified by this property shall fall within the IOMMU
  implementation-defined register region.
- qcom,iommu-bfb-data : An array of unsigned 32-bit integers representing the
  values to be programmed into the corresponding registers given by the
  qcom,iommu-bfb-regs property. If this property is present, the
  qcom,iommu-bfb-regs property shall also be present, and the lengths of both
  properties shall be the same.

Example:

	qcom,iommu@fda64000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-smmu-v2";
		reg = <0xfda64000 0x10000>;
		reg-names = "iommu_base";
		vdd-supply = <&gdsc_iommu>;
		qcom,iommu-bfb-regs = <0x204c 0x2050>;
		qcom,iommu-bfb-data = <0xffff 0xffce>;
		label = "iommu_0";

		qcom,iommu-ctx@fda6c000 {
			reg = <0xfda6c000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0 70 0>;
			qcom,iommu-ctx-sids = <0 2>;
			label = "ctx_0";
		};
		qcom,iommu-ctx@fda6d000 {
			reg = <0xfda6d000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0 71 0>;
			qcom,iommu-ctx-sids = <1>;
			label = "ctx_1";
		};
	};

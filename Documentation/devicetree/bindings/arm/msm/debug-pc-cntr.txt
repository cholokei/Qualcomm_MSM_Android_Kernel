* MSM PC Debug Counters

MSM PC debug counter reserves 16 registers in the IMEM memory space which
maintains a count on the state of power collapse on each core. This count
will be useful to debug the power collapse state on each core.

The required nodes for MSM PC Debug Counters are:

- compatible: "qcom,pc-cntr"
- reg: physical IMEM address reserved for PC counters

Example:

qcom,pc-cntr@fe800000 {
		compatible = "qcom,pc-cntr";
		reg = <0xfe800664 0x40>;
	};

Qualcomm QPNP Charger

The charger supports the switch mode battery charger and boost (SMBB)
peripherals on Qualcomm PMIC chips.

There are seven different peripherals adding the following functionality.
Each of these peripherals are implemented as subnodes in the example at the
end of this file.

- qcom,chg-chgr:	Supports charging control and status
			reporting.
- qcom,chg-bat-if:	Battery status reporting such as presence,
			temperature reporting and voltage collapse
			protection.
- qcom,chg-buck:	Charger buck configuration and status
			reporting with regards to several regulation
			loops such as vdd, ibat etc.
- qcom,usb-chgpth:	USB charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.
- qcom,dc-chgpth:	DC charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.
- qcom,chg-misc:	Miscellaneous features such as buck frequency
			settings, comparator override features etc.

Parent node required properties:
- qcom,chg-vddmax-mv:	Target voltage of battery in mV
- qcom,chg-vddsafe-mv:	Maximum Vdd voltage in mV
- qcom,chg-vinmin-mv:	Minimum input voltage in mV
- qcom,chg-vbatdet-mv:	Battery voltage at which charging resumes
- qcom,chg-ibatmax-ma:	Maximum battery charge current in mA
- qcom,chg-ibatterm-ma:	Current at which charging is terminated in mA.
- qcom,chg-ibatsafe-ma:	Safety battery current setting

Parent node optional properties:
- qcom,chg-charging-disabled:		Set this property to disable charging
					by default. This can then be overriden
					writing the the module parameter
					"charging_disabled".
- qcom,chg-use-default-batt-values:	Set this flag to force reporting of
					battery temperature of 250 decidegree
					Celsius, state of charge to be 50%
					and disable charging.

Sub node required structure:
- A qcom,chg node must be a child of an SPMI node that has specified
	the spmi-dev-container property. Each subnode reflects
	a hardware peripheral which adds a unique set of features
	to the collective charging device. For example USB detection
	and the battery interface are each seperate peripherals and
	each should be their own subnode.

Sub node required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,charger".
- reg:			Specifies the SPMI address and size for this peripheral.
- interrupts:		Specifies the interrupt associated with the peripheral.
- interrupt-names:	Specifies the interrupt names for the peripheral. Every
			available interrupt needs to have an associated name
			with it to indentify its purpose.

			The following lists each subnode and their corresponding
			required interrupt names:

			qcom,usb-chgpth:
			 - usbin-valid
			qcom,chg-chgr:
			 - chg-done
			 - chg-failed

			The following interrupts are available:

			qcom,chg-chgr:
			 - chg-done:		Triggers on charge completion.
			 - chg-failed:		Notifies of charge failures.
			 - fast-chg-on:		Notifies of fast charging state.
			 - trkl-chg-on:		Indicates trickle charging.
			 - state-change:	Notifies of a state change in
						the charger state machine.
			 - chgwdog:		Charger watchdog interrupt.
			 - vbat-det-hi:		Triggers on vbat-det-hi voltage
						setting,can be used as
						battery alarm.
			 - vbat-det-hi:		Triggers on vbat-det-low voltage
						setting, can be used as
						battery alarm.

			qcom,chg-buck:
			 - vdd-loop:		VDD loop change interrupt.
			 - ibat-loop:		Ibat loop change interrupt.
			 - ichg-loop:		Charge current loop change.
			 - vchg-loop:		Charge voltage loop change.
			 - overtemp:		Overtemperature interrupt.
			 - vref-ov:		Reference overvoltage interrupt.
			 - vbat-ov:		Battery overvoltage interrupt.

			qcom,chg-bat-if:
			 - psi:			PMIC serial interface interrupt.
			 - vcp-on:		Voltage collapse protection
						status interrupt.
			 - bat-fet-on:		BATFET status interrupt.
			 - bat-temp-ok:		Battery temperature status
						interrupt.
			 - batt-pres:		Battery presence status
						interrupt.

			qcom,usb-chgpth:
			 - usbin-valid:		Indicates valid USB connection.
			 - coarse-det-usb:	Coarse detect interrupt triggers
						at low voltage on USB_IN.
			 - chg-gone:		Triggers on VCHG line.

			qcom,dc-chgpth:
			 - dcin-valid:		Indicates a valid DC charger
						connection.
			 - coarse-det-dc:	Coarse detect interrupt triggers
						at low voltage on DC_IN.

			qcom,boost:
			 - limit-error:		Limiting error on SMBB boost.
			 - boost-pwr-ok:	Status of boost power.

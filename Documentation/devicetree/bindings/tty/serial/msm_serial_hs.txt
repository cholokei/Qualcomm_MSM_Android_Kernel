* Qualcomm MSM HSUART

Required properties:
- compatible :
	- "qcom,msm-hsuart-v14" to be used for UARTDM Core v1.4
- reg : offset and length of the register set for both the device,
	uart core and bam core
- reg-names :
	- "core_mem" to be used as name of the uart core
	- "bam_mem" to be used as name of the bam core
- interrupts : interrupts for both the device,uart core and bam core
- interrupt-names :
	- "core_irq" to be used as uart irq
	- "bam irq" to be used as bam irq
- bam-tx-ep-pipe-index : BAM TX Endpoint Pipe Index for HSUART
- bam-rx-ep-pipe-index : BAM RX Endpoint Pipe Index for HSUART

BLSP has a static pipe allocation and assumes a pair-pipe for each uart core.
Pipes [2*i : 2*i+1] are allocated for UART cores where i = [0 : 5].
Hence, Minimum and Maximum permitted value of endpoint pipe index to be used
with uart core is 0 and 11 respectively.

There is one HSUART block used in MSM devices,
"qcom,msm-hsuart-v14". The msm-serial-hs driver is
able to handle this, and matches against the "qcom,msm-hsuart-v14"
as the compatibility.

The registers for the "qcom,msm-hsuart-v14" device need to specify both
register blocks - uart core and bam core.

Example:

	uart7@f995d000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-hsuart-v14";
		reg = <0xf995d000 0x1000>,
		      <0xf9944000 0x5000>;
		reg-names = "core_mem", "bam_mem";
		interrupts = <0 113 0>, <0 239 0>;
		interrupt-names = "core_irq", "bam_irq";
	};

Optional properties:
- qcom,<gpio-name>-gpio : handle to the GPIO node, see "gpios property" in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt.
"gpio-name" can be "tx", "rx", "cts" and "rfr" based on number of UART GPIOs
need to configured.
Gpio's are optional if it is required to be not configured by UART driver or
case where there is nothing connected and we want to use internal loopback mode
for uart.
- qcom, wakeup_irq : UART RX GPIO IRQ line to be configured as wakeup source.
- qcom,inject_rx_on_wakeup : inject_rx_on_wakeup enables feature where on
receiving interrupt with UART RX GPIO IRQ line (i.e. above wakeup_irq property),
HSUART driver injects provided character with property rx_to_inject.
- qcom, rx_to_inject : The character to be inserted on wakeup.
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
below optional properties:
    - qcom,msm_bus,name
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,active_only
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors

Example:

	uart7: uart@f995d000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-hsuart-v14"
		reg = <0x19c40000 0x1000">,
		      <0xf9944000 0x5000>;
		reg-names = "core_mem", "bam_mem";
		interrupts = <0 113 0>, <0 239 0>;
		interrupt-names = "core_irq", "bam_irq";

		qcom,tx-gpio = <&msmgpio 41 0x00>;
		qcom,rx-gpio = <&msmgpio 42 0x00>;
		qcom,cts-gpio = <&msmgpio 43 0x00>;
		qcom,rfr-gpio = <&msmgpio 44 0x00>;

		qcom,bam-tx-ep-pipe-index = <0>;
		qcom,bam-rx-ep-pipe-index = <1>;

		qcom,msm-bus,name = "uart7";
		qcom,msm-bus,num-cases = <2>;
		qcom,msm-bus,active-only = <0>;
		qcom,msm-bus,num-paths = <1>;
		qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps =
				<84 512 0 0>,
				<84 512 500 800>;
	};

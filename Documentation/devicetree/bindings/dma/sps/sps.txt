SPS (Smart Peripheral Switch) may be used as a DMA engine to move data
in either the Peripheral-to-Peripheral (a.k.a. BAM-to-BAM) mode or the
Peripheral-to-Memory (a.k.a. BAM-System) mode. SPS includes BAM (Bus
Access Module) hardware block, BAM DMA peripheral, and pipe memory.

Required property:
  - compatible: should be "qcom,msm_sps"

Optional properties:
  - reg: offset and size of the register set in the memory map
  - interrupts: IRQ line
  - qcom,device-type: specify the device configuration of BAM DMA and
    pipe memory. Can be one of
        1 - With BAM DMA and without pipe memory
        2 - With BAM DMA and with pipe memory
        3 - Without BAM DMA and without pipe memory

Example:

	qcom,sps@f9980000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm_sps";
		reg = <0xf9984000 0x15000>,
		      <0xf9999000 0xb000>,
		      <0xfe803000 0x4800>;
		interrupts = <0 94 0>;
		qcom,device-type = <2>;
	};

MSM SuperSpeed USB3.0 SoC controller

Required properties :
- compatible : should be "qcom,dwc-usb3-msm"
- reg : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
	offset and length of the TCSR register for routing USB
	signals to either picoPHY0 or picoPHY1.
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- interrupt-names : Required interrupt resource entries are:
	"irq" : Interrupt for DWC3 core
	"otg_irq" : Interrupt for DWC3 core's OTG Events
- <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" examples are:
	"SSUSB_lp8" : 1.8v supply for SSPHY
	"HSUSB_1p8" : 1.8v supply for HSPHY
	"HSUSB_3p3" : 3.3v supply for HSPHY
	"vbus_dwc3" : vbus supply for host mode
	"ssusb_vdd_dig" : vdd supply for SSPHY digital circuit operation
	"hsusb_vdd_dig" : vdd supply for HSPHY digital circuit operation
- qcom,dwc-usb3-msm-dbm-eps: Number of endpoints avaliable for
  the DBM (Device Bus Manager). The DBM is HW unit which is part of
  the MSM USB3.0 core (which also includes the Synopsys DesignWare
  USB3.0 controller)
- qcom,vdd-voltage-level: This property must be a list of three integer
  values (no, min, max) where each value represents either a voltage in
  microvolts or a value corresponding to voltage corner

Optional properties :
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
  below optional properties:
    - qcom,msm_bus,name
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_cases
    - qcom,msm_bus,active_only
    - qcom,msm_bus,num_paths
    - qcom,msm_bus,vectors
- interrupt-names : Optional interrupt resource entries are:
    "hs_phy_irq" : Interrupt from HSPHY for asynchronous events in LPM.
	This is not used if wakeup events are received externally (e.g. PMIC)
- qcom,otg-capability: If present then depend on PMIC for VBUS notifications,
  otherwise depend on PHY.
- qcom,charging-disabled: If present then battery charging using USB
  is disabled.
- qcom,dwc-hsphy-init: This property if present represents phy init
  value to be used for overriding HSPHY parameters into QSCRATCH register.
  This 32 bit value represents parameters as follows:
		bits 0-5   PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_A
		bits 6-12  PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_B
		bits 13-19 PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_C
		bits 20-25 PARAMETER_OVERRIDE_D
